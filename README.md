# Stars Orbits in the Galaxy

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for simulating and analyzing the orbits of stars in a galaxy. The notebook implements numerical methods to compute stellar trajectories based on gravitational models and initial conditions. The objective is to build orbits for stars in different positions in the Galaxy (bulge, disk, or halo) over time.

## Features
- Numerical integration of stellar orbits
- Visualization of trajectories in a galactic potential
- Analysis of energy and angular momentum conservation
- Customizable initial conditions for simulations

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib astropy scipy jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stars-orbits-galaxy.git
   cd stars-orbits-galaxy
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Stars Orbits in the Galaxy.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the cells in order to generate orbit simulations and analyses.
