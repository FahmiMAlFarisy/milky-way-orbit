# Stars Orbits in the Galaxy

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for simulating and analyzing the orbits of stars in a galaxy. The notebook implements numerical methods to compute stellar trajectories based on gravitational models and initial conditions.

## Features
- Numerical integration of stellar orbits
- Visualization of trajectories in a galactic potential
- Analysis of energy and angular momentum conservation
- Customizable initial conditions for simulations

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib astropy scipy jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stars-orbits-galaxy.git
   cd stars-orbits-galaxy
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Stars Orbits in the Galaxy.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the cells in order to generate orbit simulations and analyses.

## Examples
- Plotting stellar orbits in a 2D projection
- Comparing different initial conditions
- Evaluating energy conservation over time
